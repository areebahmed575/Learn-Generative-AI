You might see it spelled as \"Satpara\" or \"Sadpara\" on the internet. But I think \"Sadpara\" makes more sense, because it matches the name of the nearby village, the local people, and the legendary Ali Sadpara.Now, let me tell you about our family trip to this beautiful lake. We were on our way to Deosai, and we saw this stunning turquoise water sparkling in the sun. It was so tempting to stop and take some selfies, but we had a long journey ahead of us. So, we just admired it from our car window and snapped some quick pictures. Here are some of them for you to enjoy.Trust me, this lake is worth a visit. It will make you feel happy, even if it's called Sadpara.Read moreReview of: Sadpara LakeWritten October 23, 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

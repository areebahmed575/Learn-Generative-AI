      " Conference Venues Rental Guide \n",
      "The San Francisco Bay Area is the perfect place to hold your next conference. The area boasts a diverse range of conference venues for rent, from historic buildings to modern high-rise towers. Whether you're looking for a venue that offers a unique experience for your guests or space to accommodate large groups, here are some of the tips you may find useful when renting a conference venue:\n",
      "Make sure the venue is easy to find and get to. Check whether it has adequate parking space or is situated close to major hotels, airports, or other important locations. The venue should also have decent access to a good network of transportation links. \n",
      "Find a venue that fits your guests like a glove. The capacity of the venue should be able to accommodate your expected number of attendees and provide the necessary furniture and equipment for your event.\n",
      "Check if the venue can cater to your needs. If the venue doesn't have in-house catering, it might permit outside services. In some cases, they may offer you a list of recommended vendors who can assist you with your catering needs.\n",
      "Find a venue with the proper infrastructure. Make sure that there are enough restrooms, cloakrooms, etc., for your guests. If you’re planning an event with multiple breakout sessions or workshops, make sure the venue has enough breakout rooms. If you're planning a large event, you may be able to rent out an entire floor in a building or have the venue at your disposal for the entire day.\n",
      "Make sure the venue has the necessary equipment. Some venues have their own equipment that can be used for your conference, but others may require you to bring your own. This might include PA systems, microphones, projectors, and screens. If you want to use any special equipment during your event, check if the venue has them available.\n",
      "Check if the venue has a built-in sound system. You need to make sure that your guests can hear the speakers clearly when they attend your conference. You may want to rent wireless microphones to avoid the hassle of dealing with tangled wires.\n",
      "Make sure the venue has adequate lighting. The venue should be able to accommodate your choice of natural or artificial lighting, depending on the ambience that matches your preference. Natural lighting is better for creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere while artificial lighting is more suitable for creating a professional ambience.\n",
      "Ensure that the venue has air conditioning. You need to make sure that your guests are comfortable throughout the event and can enjoy themselves without being distracted by heat or humidity. You can also opt for a venue with a cooling system instead. \n",
      "Check if you can customize the space to your needs. You should have control over the layout of the venue's space to create the best possible environment for your conference. Special seating arrangements may be necessary if you are giving a speech and need to address the audience from the stage.\n",
      "Conferences and meetings are a great way to get together with your team, clients, or other people in your industry. They can be used to promote products and services or create stronger relationships with your network. People often rent conference venues for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n",
      "Business Meetings. If you need to host a business meeting, then renting a conference venue is probably the best way to go about it. Many businesses have regular meetings with clients and suppliers, and these events can be held at a rented conference venue instead of a cramped meeting room.\n",
      "Conferences. If you have a large group of people who need to attend a conference, then you need a suitable venue for such events. Most of these venues have the facilities needed to run a successful conference, including catering services, audio-visual equipment, and a stage for speakers and presentations.\n",
      "Networking Events. If you're in the business of connecting people, then a conference venue can be an important part of your strategy. Choosing the right venue can increase the sense of prestige or success surrounding your event. It's also great for building your brand and displaying your talents as a speaker or host. \n",
      "Exhibitions. Renting a conference venue is a great way to showcase your products and services to potential customers or clients in an attractive and professional setting. You can take advantage of the opportunity to impress your guests and make connections with potential partners.\n",
      "Conventions. If you want to get your colleagues together for an annual event to learn about the latest trends in their field and network with others in their industry, renting a conference venue might be just what you need! You may also want to rent a conference venue if you have an important announcement to make or want to hold a special celebration.\n",
      "Training Sessions. Training sessions are a great way for your company to stay on top of the latest trends in your industry. If your company is looking to train its employees, why not rent a conference venue and bring everyone together? This gives you the opportunity to hire a professional trainer and host a seminar that is relevant to your business in a professional setting. \n",
      "Expos. These events are intended to show off your product and generate some buzz around it. They're also a great way to get exposure, which can be difficult if you're hosting your event in a cramped space. Consider renting a conference venue instead to make the most of your time and money.\n",
      "FAQs about Conference Venues in San Francisco, CA\n",
      "How much does it cost to rent a conference venue in San Francisco?\n",
      "The average price for renting a conference venue is about $1,500-$2,000 per session. This price is based on the location and number of guests attending the event. If you have more than 300 people coming to your conference, you should expect to pay at least $2,500+ per session. The price of your conference will also increase depending on how many days it lasts and whether or not you need catering.\n",
      "Which areas of San Francisco are best for renting a conference venue?\n",
      "The Financial District. This area is perfect for conferences of any size and price range, with spaces that range from intimate to expansive. It's also got plenty of hotels nearby if you need accommodation.\n",
      "Downtown. This district has a lot of great options for conference venues, from historic buildings to modern spaces designed with your needs in mind. It's also close to the Financial District, so it won't take you long to get there!\n",
      "Russian Hill. If you're looking for something more historic or old-fashioned than what the Financial District has to offer, check out Russian Hill! The neighborhood is known for its Victorian houses, which make it a great place for conference venues that have a unique flair.\n",
      "Union Square. This area has some great options too! It's a very modern area with lots of restaurants and hotels, which makes it a great choice if you're planning on having some events during the conference. \n",
      "What are some of the best conference venues in San Francisco?\n",
      "Main Hall at Trellis. This versatile space can accommodate everything from daytime conferences under the sun to evening panel discussions. With its brick walls and redwood rafters, it got the rustic charm of an old-school barn—except it's got Edison bulbs instead of hay bales. It was designed to be a comfortable, inviting space with satin curtains and a curated collection of art and furniture. It's the perfect place to hold a special event that is going to delight your guests.\n",
      "California Ballroom at Oakstop Franklin. This is a quintessential venue for your next conference. Its beautiful art deco architecture is going to leave your guests in awe, and the adjoining meeting lounge offers more options for groups that require a VIP area, a breakout space, etc. Don’t let the name fool you, as this is not just a ballroom, but rather a multi-purpose venue that can be configured to accommodate different types of events, including large conferences and corporate meetings.\n",
      "Meeting Room at Homewood Suites. The venue is conveniently located in downtown Brisbane, just a few miles away from the airport. It's a bright, warm room that is ideal for ensuring that your attendees can concentrate on the topic at hand. The room can be set up with a whiteboard, or you can use the projector to display presentations. The venue also provides in-house catering and complimentary water. It's perfect for conferences and takes advantage of the narrow focus that serves a small group of attendees.\n",
      "What should I consider when choosing a conference venue in San Francisco?\n",
      "The most important thing to consider when planning an event is how your guests will interact with each other—and what amenities you can offer them to make their experience relaxing and productive. When you're searching for venues, look for places that offer Wi-Fi, projectors and screens, comfortable seating options, and a PA system or music speakers. You may also want to include amenities like food options (if you're holding an event that lasts more than a few hours) and on-site parking in your search. It's also important to consider if the venue has breakout rooms or dedicated spaces for attendees to hold private discussions. If you're planning a seminar or training event that takes place over the course of a few days, find a venue with lodging accommodations, like hotels with conference rooms.\n",

The days of printing flyers to promote your in-person event and handing them out on the sidewalk to local foot traffic are gone. We now have conversational artificial intelligence tools that pass medical exams and virtual reality technology that intertwines dimensions.Although printed flyers can be effective, technology has upped the ante. Why work harder to promote in-person events when you can work smarter and achieve better results? Consider using a contemporary flyer maker for dynamic digital promotions. Easily share eye-catching materials online to reach a broader audience and amplify the impact of your event promotions.This guide will explore seven creative strategies to help you get the word out and make your next in-person event successful.Are you ready to hit the ball out of the park?Let’s dive in.Host a webinar as a lead magnet.Did you know that 99% of businesses believe webinars are one of the most crucial parts of their marketing strategy?Offering a free webinar is the perfect way to gain credibility by sharing your expertise and encouraging people to sign up for your in-person event.Consider when you received a free trial and later decided to purchase the item due to how great it was (e.g., perfume, food delivery service, TV subscription platform, etc.). That’s where a webinar shines. It’s like a sneak peek of how fantastic your in-person event will be.And when you use a webinar as a lead magnet, it’s a surefire way to secure buy-in from your target audience. Then, with the help of user onboarding software, you can easily send in-app messages to users about your upcoming in-person events with all of the details in one seamless platform.Send targeted email campaigns.Email marketing is one of the most lucrative marketing strategies, with an average return on investment (ROI) of $36 for every $1 you spend.Why?Any industry can use email marketing successfully It’s a cheap way to send messages to a large audience You can segment your emails to the right audienceHere’s an example of how you could use targeted email to promote a dental conference:Segment your email list: Start by dividing your email list into segments based on factors such as job title, location, and past attendance at similar events. Create a targeted message that resonates with a specific group of people. Craft a compelling subject line: The subject line is the first thing people will see when they receive your email, so make it as persuasive as possible. For a dental conference, you could use a subject line like “Transform Your Dental Practice with Cutting-Edge Techniques and Technology” or “How to Avoid Turkey Teeth and Other Botched Dental Mishaps.” Highlight the key benefits: In the body of the email, focus on the key benefits attendees will receive from attending your conference. Highlight the opportunity to learn from top industry experts, network with other dental professionals, get hands-on experience with new tools, and understand how much the best quality veneers cost. Use engaging visuals: Bring your message to life with eye-catching images and videos. You could include photos of past attendees and speaker sessions or leverage an infographic to share more details. Include a clear call-to-action in your email signature: End your email with a clear call-to-action that encourages people to sign up for the conference. Make it easy for them to include a link to your registration page.Table of Contents Toggle3. Connect with a sponsor4. Dabble in virtual reality5. Start a referral program6. Partner with micro-influencers7. Create a viral video on TikTokWrapping up3. Connect with a sponsorMaximize the benefits of securing sponsors for your event by collaborating with them on promotions and marketing. With their investment in the success of your event, they’re likely willing to engage in cross-promotional opportunities.Sponsors can bring valuable marketing resources, such as an extensive network of followers and a trusted reputation within your target audience.Rolex is the powerhouse behind TED conferences. Talk about a dynamic duo. Rolex fans are more inclined to attend a TED event for the inside scoop on scoring the latest Rolex watches.You can also leverage your sponsor by including them in your event programming. Some opportunities include participation in panels, giving presentations, or hosting branded activities.By involving your sponsor in this way, you can help promote your event and build a deeper relationship with your sponsor, leading to even more opportunities for future events.When choosing a sponsor, make sure it’s a good fit. Look for a company or brand that aligns with your event’s values and objectives. Don’t accept the first brand that’ll write you a check.For example, suppose you are hosting an in-person event for local real estate agents in Nashville, Tennessee. In that case, you’ll want to find a sponsorship partner like a real estate marketing platform.Just as real estate professionals utilize unique tactics to attract buyers, event organizers can adopt creative methods to engage attendees and create memorable event experiences. Discover the opulence of Dubai penthouses for sale and elevate your lifestyle.Organizing these events in person requires studying strategies to promote face-to-face events for the organizational phase. Among these, it is also fair to mention the internal organization of the company to coordinate all teams throughout the process.Some board meeting software, such as OnBoard, can be helpful during organizational reunions (including face-to-face meetings) to quickly summarize critical points of conferences and save time and information gaps between teams.These small details matter, enhancing the credibility of your event.4. Dabble in virtual realityUnderstanding your target audience is the secret sauce to any successful marketing campaign.So if your target audience is primarily Millenials and Gen Z, how can you understand the best way to reach them?That’s where a customer data platform (CDP) comes into play. CDPs like Segment can provide you with the tools to build a 360-degree view of your customers to determine their needs and how to spark their interest.For instance, did you know that nearly 40% of Gen Z and Millennials are interested in attending virtual concerts of their favorite musical artists? Why not use this information about your target audience to your advantage when promoting your in-person event?Virtual reality (VR) is a cutting-edge technology that can increase buzz and excitement for your in-person events in 2023. VR provides your attendees with a unique and immersive experience that differentiates your event from others in the market.Take Intel’s presentation at the 2017 CES conference as the perfect example.Intel transported 260 attendees to breathtaking destinations with VR. She left attendees in awe, from soaring above Moab, Utah, in a wingsuit to witnessing the stunning Ban Goic waterfall in Vietnam and ending with courtside seats at an NCAA basketball game.The virtual journey culminated with the audience finding themselves back in their seats at the Las Vegas event, still in disbelief.VR technology also helps reduce friction for busy people who can’t attend the event.For instance, if you’re hosting a multi-day conference about technological advances in the courier service industry, attendees who can’t make it all four days can still experience the event through VR.By providing a virtual experience, you harp on the technology side of things while reaching a wider audience and generating more interest in your event.5. Start a referral programStarting a referral program can be a fun and effective way to promote your in-person event and incentivize people to help spread the word.The idea is simple — offer a discount on tickets to those referred by someone already registered, and reward the referring party with something sweet.Here’s a step-by-step guide on to start your referral program:Offer a mouth-watering incentive: Your referral program needs a clear and irresistible encouragement to encourage participation. For instance, offer a discount on referral tickets, complimentary access, or another reward to the referring party (free swag, commissions, etc.) Make sharing a breeze: Make it easy for people to share your referral program with others. Create shareable links and email templates or provide pre-written social media posts or poster templates to help simplify the process. Track the referrals: Use a unique referral link or code for each participant to help you track the program’s progress.A referral program can create a buzz around your event while incentivizing your attendees to spread the word.Get creative with your incentives; you’ll be surprised how quickly referrals start rolling in.6. Partner with micro-influencersIn 2023, influencer marketing emerged as a top marketing strategy by leveraging the influence of word-of-mouth and amplifying it through social media.Most people trust personal recommendations from friends or family. But the reach here’s limited to a one-to-one interaction. You can increase your reach tenfold with the power of influencer marketing.And did you know that micro-influencers with less than 100,000 followers drive up to 60% higher engagement than macro-influencers?For example, Jeremy Moser, the CEO at uSERP, would be the perfect influencer for a marketing event powered by an SEO tool like Ahrefs or Semrush.Remember to underestimate the power of an influencer. If you need help finding influencers in your niche, you can leverage a quick Google search or invest in an influencer marketing platform.7. Create a viral video on TikTokTikTok has taken the world by storm and has quickly become one of the world’s most popular social media platforms.With its growing user base and fun-loving community, it’s an excellent social platform to create a video that promotes your in-person event. Plus, you have a high chance of the video going viral.Music is a massive part of TikTok, and incorporating a popular or trending song into your video can help make it more appealing to viewers. Choose a tune that’s upbeat, catchy, and fits the tone of your event to create a fun and memorable video.TikTok is a platform where users want to be entertained and inspired. So get your creative juices flowing and try to stand out by using humor, storytelling, and engaging visuals to make your video exciting and memorable.And for the icing on the cake, leverage a social media scheduler to share the video at the optimal time when your target audience is on the app.Ideally, you want your video to reach as many viewers as possible. Viral videos are worth their weight in gold. Test the waters with TikTok to unlock the power of this social media powerhouse.Wrapping upThe key to successful event promotion lies in finding creative and innovative ways to reach your target audience.There are many ways to generate buzz and excitement for your events, from leveraging social media and influencer marketing to starting a referral program and connecting with sponsors.So whether you’re a seasoned event planner or new to the field, these strategies will help drive a sold-out crowd to your next event.Happy planning!Theu author Kelly Moser is the co-founder and editor at Home & Jet, a digital magazine for the modern era.

Download nowYou're getting ready to host a webinar and you want to get it right. But what to do if you have connectivity issues? Or your audience gets bored in the first 10 minutes? No worries, we've got you covered.\n",
      "Being a webinar host sounds like a big responsibility, and while you shouldn’t take it lightly, you don’t have to do it all by yourself. You can get a moderator, an assistant, and a speaker to help out.\n",
      "In this article, we’ll explain which responsibilities fall on your plate and how to plan everything from idea generation to the wrap-up. You’ll also find a few tips from Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm, and insights from our user’s webinar statistics.\n",
      "Download the Ebook to learn how to boost webinar registrationsEbooksWebinar Promotion HandbookEverything you need to promote your webinars and increase attendance.Download What is a webinar host?\n",
      "A webinar host is the person in charge of running a webinar. As a host, you’re generally responsible for starting the event, introducing any speakers, and leading a live Q&A at the end.\n",
      "A host can sometimes be referred to as the “master of ceremony” or “MC”. That’s because they’re responsible for guiding the audience through the webinar experience, but aren’t necessarily same person as the keynote speaker.\n",
      "What’s the role of a webinar host?\n",
      "The role of a webinar host is to ensure the guest speakers and audience are looked after throughout the event and that everything runs smoothly. Sometimes, the host has a few backstage responsibilities too, like putting together a presentation or showing speakers how to use the webinar platform. As a host, you need to:\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "The webinar host is usually an unofficial brand ambassador. You’re responsible for ensuring all the content follows your brand guidelines and meets the objectives of the webinar. As a master of ceremony, you also need to embody the company’s values and brand voice.\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "The host is not necessarily the person that will lead the webinar from start to finish; rather, the one who will manage the flow of the event. This person usually welcomes everyone to the virtual room and explains the rules and online event agenda.\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "During the welcome segment, the host is responsible for pointing out some of the engagement functions of the webinar software. You can explain how to:\n",
      "Use the Q&A tab\n",
      "Vote on polls\n",
      "Interact on a virtual whiteboard\n",
      "Request to go on stage\n",
      "React using emojis\n",
      "Analyze your dataAnalyze all of your data with Livestorm's powerful reporting features.Sign up for free Introduce speakers\n",
      "Another crucial role of the host is to invite the speakers onstage and introduce them one by one. Make sure you ask the speakers for a short bio and adjust it for the webinar presentation.\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "As a host, you also need to brush up on the subject matter. That way, you can help smooth the conversation flow or continue the presentation if the speakers have trouble with their internet connection.\n",

      "To host a memorable webinar, you need to follow a series of steps before, during, and after the session. While online events are all different, you can turn this list into a step-by-step project plan or Gantt chart template and use it for future webinars. Focus on these areas to host a successful webinar:\n",

      "If you want to see a summarized version of the steps, check out this video from our Content Manager, Daniella.\n",
      "How to plan a webinar\n",
      "When planning a webinar, there are two main things to consider: the audience and your virtual event platform. All the steps listed will revolve around these two areas. Here’s how to plan a webinar:\n",
      "Choose a topic\n",
      "Get to know your platform\n",
      "Pick a format\n",
      "Assign roles\n",
      "Set a date and time\n",
      "Build a registration page\n",
      "Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "1. Choose a webinar topic\n",
      "The first step is to pick a topic. Use tools like Answer The Public or Also Asked to see what your audience is searching for online. Make sure you decide on a topic that relates to your brand and where you have some level of expertise.\n",
      "2. Get to know your webinar platform\n",
      "Next, get familiar with your company's webinar platform. Experiment with it, set up a call with yourself or teammates, and test the features. Some people recommend doing this later in the process, but we suggest you do this early on so you can plan engagement activities around what the tool offers and what you can do with it.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, you can get familiar with the platform by hosting regular team meetings and using engagement functionalities like:\n",
      "Q&A tab\n",
      "CTA buttons\n",
      "Breakout rooms\n",
      "Polls\n",
      "3. Pick a webinar format\n",
      "After you’ve discovered everything you can do with your webinar platform, define the format. You can choose from:\n",
      "Panel discussions. This means inviting 3-5 people onstage to discuss a set of predetermined questions on a topic.\n",
      "Ask me anything or Q&As. This format usually involves the host answering audience inquiries. With Livestorm, you can easily invite people on stage and allow them to unmute themselves and ask questions.\n",
      "Regular presentations. This is when you invite an expert speaker to run a presentation on a topic using a slide deck.\n",
      "Interviews or press conferences. This format is a bit less common for webinars, but you can invite a popular speaker and allow the audience to ask questions. It’s different from a Q&A session because you get to use the content for public sharing, such as a written press release.\n",
      "On-demand webinars. This is just like a regular webinar except you don’t need to be physically present. Use an on-demand webinar platform like Livestorm to pre-record your webinar and set up automations to host the event without any live intervention. Or, simply upload it to your website as gated content to generate leads whenever it gets downloaded.\n",
      "4. Assign roles\n",
      "Choose your webinar A-team and assign them responsibilities, such as:\n",
      "Speaker or trainer to deliver educational content\n",
      "Moderator to manage the backstage, encourage conversation in the chat tab, filter questions, and monitor audio and video quality\n",
      "Assistant to help the moderator and cover for them in case of emergencies\n",
      "Host or organizer to plan and lead the webinar from start to finish and ensure both the speakers and audience are looked after\n",
      "\"It's handy to have the moderator chat feature, especially when you have a lot of speakers. That way you can ping them and ask 'can we speed it up?' or whatever” said Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm. “You can send notes that are only in the moderator chat and not public to the webinar attendees.\"\n",
      "5. Set a date and time\n",
      "It’s not an event until you’ve set a date and time! Coordinate with your team to find a slot that works best for all of you.\n",
      "Our webinar statistics show that the best days to host events are Wednesdays and Thursdays. That said, every audience is different so you could run a quick, informal survey to see when yours are most likely to join.\n",
      "Pro tip: You can use software like Typeform to create surveys and find your target audience’s primary time zone. Post on social media to reach them or, depending on your survey software, pay to get answers from your target audience.\n",
      "6. Build a registration page\n",
      "Before promoting a webinar, you need a landing page to collect attendee registration. If you’re using Livestorm, you get access to an automatically generated webinar registration page as soon as you schedule your meeting. You can customize the colors and fonts to match your branding, add custom fields to the form, and set a registration limit.\n",
      "Customize registration pagesCreate and customize registration pages that are optimized for conversionSign up for free 7. Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "Your webinar needs an audience and it’s your job to:\n",
      "Come up with a catchy webinar title\n",
      "Capture the attention of potential attendees\n",
      "Explore topics that interest your target audience\n",
      "Invite them to register\n",
      "Keep them engaged with your brand before, during, and after the event\n",
      "To achieve this, you have to create a marketing plan to promote your webinar. Include the type of content, timeline, and media outlets. A common strategy is to use a combination of organic social media and paid ads for a month for better reach and conversions.\n",
      "Pro tip: According to our stats on webinar marketing, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the best days to send out invitations to your event.\n",
      "How to structure a webinar presentation\n",
      "It’s among webinar best practices to create a structured and attention-grabbing presentation. To do so, follow these steps:\n",
      "Create an outline\n",
      "Define your agenda\n",
      "Include visuals\n",
      "Plan for engagement\n",
      "1. Create an outline\n",
      "Avoid being 40 slides in and not even close to finishing on time by creating a skeleton of your presentation first. This will help determine the length of your presentation and keep your thoughts organized. It also shows you where you can plan engaging activities for your talk.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, create your presentation directly on Visme, and include a short description on each slide. Then, use the app integration to share your presentation, skip, and click on your slides directly from the webinar tab.\n",
      "2. Define your agenda\n",
      "Creating an outline will practically write the agenda for you: make a list of the content on each slide and add it to the beginning of the presentation. A good agenda will help you keep to time, especially if your webinar moderator is given an estimate per item.\n",
      "\"The biggest challenge for keeping an audience engaged is keeping track of time and making sure that the speakers don't go over,” explained Pauline. “Sometimes they get off track. So, it's about making that choice: do I refocus the conversation or do I cut some of these questions?\"\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm or Zoom, you chat with your moderator through a private in-app tab that the public can’t see. That way, if you’re running out of time or decide to skip questions to move the webinar along, you can communicate with each other easily.\n",
      "3. Include visuals\n",
      "Avoid creating a slide deck that’s filled with long blocks of text. Remember, you’re not creating an e-book, you’re designing visual aid to make your webinar more engaging. Add pictures, videos, and gifs to make it more dynamic and eye-catching.\n",
      "Pro tip: Use contrasting colors (opposites in the chromatic circle) or a lighter shade to make some sentences stand out.\n",
      "4. Plan for engagement\n",
      "Sometimes you book a speaker who looks good on paper but ends up delivering a boring talk anyway. Before the webinar, chat about their presentation and make sure they know how to make the most of the platform's engagement features. Suggest they plan ahead for interactive elements, like using Miro’s digital whiteboard to take suggestions from the audience or sharing additional resources as they go using the Livestorm Handouts plugin.\n",
      "How to start a webinar\n",
      "Welcoming your audience is also about setting them up for success. Kick off the call by explaining the ground rules and the meeting agenda. Do it in this order:\n",
      "Welcome your audience\n",
      "Set ground rules\n",
      "Share agenda points\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "1. Welcome your audience\n",
      "Start the webinar with your camera on, but don’t share your screen yet. When it’s time to start the presentation, unmute yourself, and welcome everyone for joining. If you’re waiting for more people to join, announce that you’ll wait for 3 minutes before you begin, but don’t stay silent – e.g. ask people where they’re joining from.\n",
      "2. Set ground rules\n",
      "Say hello to the ones who joined a bit late and explain basic ground rules:\n",
      "Is this a camera on or off type of session?\n",
      "When and how to ask questions\n",
      "How long will it last?\n",
      "Do they need to take notes or are you sharing the information?\n",
      "Remind everyone to be kind and respectful\n",
      "Open the floor for questions before moving on to the next slide.\n",
      "3. Share agenda points\n",
      "Give your audience an overview of what to expect from the session, including details of any comfort breaks. You can also take this opportunity to point out features like the Q&A tab, emoji reactions, and the “raise a hand” feature to help them navigate the webinar platform.\n",
      "4. Introduce other speakers\n",
      "Introduce the guest speaker(s) and invite them on stage. Make sure you pronounce their names properly and give an accurate professional description. Explain your role and cede the floor.\n",
      "How to keep your audience engaged during a webinar\n",
      "Engaging a virtual audience during live webinars might sound like a tough gig, but it’s definitely possible. Here’s what you need to do:\n",
      "Conduct live polls\n",
      "Open with an icebreaker\n",
      "Play a game throughout the webinar\n",
      "Run Q&A sessions\n",
      "1. Conduct live polls\n",
      "Keeping your audience engaged can be as simple as asking questions to include them in the conversation. Use the polls feature – almost all the best webinar platforms have one – to ask questions with multiple-choice answers.\n",
      "For example, you can use polls to introduce surprising facts and gauge your audience's pre-existing knowledge of the topic. Or just bring one in to break the ice by asking questions like \"How energized are you feeling today?\" (more on that below).\n",
      "2. Open with an icebreaker\n",
      "Depending on the type of webinar, you can play an icebreaker with the speakers or the audience. “You can use an icebreaker that’s completely linked to the topic so you can ask the panelists,” explains Pauline. “For other webinars, I’d host the icebreaker with the audience. I can ask where they are tuned in from or if there is anything specific they want to hear.”\n",
      "You can find hundreds of icebreaker ideas online. Pick one that’ll take no longer than 3 minutes and invite your audience to participate. Try this: share a meme of a TV character making different faces using a digital whiteboard. Ask attendees to add a post-it on top of the picture they feel is the most relatable.\n",
      "3. Play a game throughout the webinar\n",
      "Explain the game at the beginning of the webinar and play it throughout the presentation. For example, you can hide an emoji in specific slides and get attendees to use Livestorm’s emoji reactions to notify you when they find it. Inviting your audience to play a game with you builds a sense of camaraderie. Plus, it encourages them to pay more attention as they might lose the game if they get distracted.\n",
      "4. Run Q&A sessions\n",
      "If you’re hosting any kind of event with a large audience, let them ask questions. Invite them to\n",
      "Unmute themselves and ask questions directly at any time\n",
      "Virtually raise their hands or react with an emoji to notify they have a question\n",
      "Add questions to the Q&A tab\n",
      "Ask their questions at the end of the webinar\n",
      "Pro tip: With Livestorm’s Q&A tab, attendees can ask questions at any time and the rest of the audience can upvote their favorites. Get your moderator to manage the questions list and message the speaker privately whenever it’s time to answer them.\n",
      "Host better webinars with an end-to-end platformMeet the first webinar software that enables you to record webinars effortlessly.Try Livestorm for freeHow to end a webinar\n",
      "Time to wrap up! End your webinar on a positive note and use the analytics to improve future sessions. Follow these steps to close your session:\n",
      "Share key learnings\n",
      "Add a CTA button\n",
      "Send an automatic recording of the session\n",
      "1. Share key learnings\n",
      "Thank everyone for joining. Create a closing slide with a summary of everything they learned that day. Depending on your webinar format, you can ask the audience to share their takeaways or “aha!” moments with the room as a nice way to wrap up the meeting.\n",
      "2. Add a call-to-action (CTA) button\n",
      "End your presentation with a clear and engaging CTA. The link can redirect them to\n",
      "The registration form for a future session\n",
      "A web page where they can buy a product or download an e-book\n",
      "A Calendly link to set up a demo call with your sales team\n",
      "A feedback form for them to rate the session\n",
      "The speaker’s and company’s social media handles\n",
      "Pro tip: If you’re using Livestorm, use the CTA feature to include a clickable link on your screen. If you’re using a different platform, but use Chrome as your browser, you can generate a free QR code to link to a specific page. Simply click on the share icon on the URL bar, click “create QR code”, and download the picture to add it to your presentation.\n",
      "3. Send an automatic recording of the webinar\n",
      "When you host webinars, you want to present interesting information to as many prospects as possible. It’s common for people to sign up for online events and not show up. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t interested in your content or product - they just couldn’t join.\n",
      "At Livestorm, we’ve discovered that our platform's average attendance rate to events is 58% (that’s higher than other tools). We’ve also discovered that 31% of no-shows (people who registered but didn’t attend) watch the webinar recording. So, you should always record your webinar and share the replay to capture potential customers’ attention even when they couldn’t join live. If you’re using Livestorm as your automated webinar tool, we’ll send the email with the replay link as soon as the session ends for you.\n",
      "4. Review the webinar analytics\n",
      "In life and in webinars, you can only improve if you know what you did wrong. So, go to the people’s dashboard (on Livestorm) and review your engagement metrics. If you’re hosting webinars for lead generation purposes, download the contacts record report. There, you’ll find your attendee’s contact information that you can include in your email list and nurture the high-quality leads.\n",
      "Hosting a webinar: It’s all about preparation\n",
      "Webinar hosts are responsible for running successful brand awareness, educational, and lead generation virtual sessions. And jumping in to save the day in case anything goes sideways. Your role as a webinar host includes:\n",
      "Designing the webinar content\n",
      "Welcoming attendees\n",
      "Supporting your speakers\n",
      "Making it engaging\n",
      "Wrapping it up\n",
      "Apart from making everything go smoothly, you should anticipate issues and come up with a contingency plan. This means, having a relevant video at hand or a backup practice exercise.\n",
      "As the host, you need to be an expert in the platform and be able to do any of the planned actions without any hassle. If you’re on the Livestorm Enterprise plan, you can ask us to shadow your next webinar (or a dry run) and give you technical support and pointers.\n",
      "Key takeaways before hosting your webinar\n",
      "There are several steps to follow to guarantee your webinar is interesting, engaging, and designed to get participants to complete the call to action. Here are the key takeaways.\n",
      "To plan a webinar you need to carefully research your target audience as you choose the topic and invite guest speakers. Set yourself goals and success measures to evaluate your webinar later.\n",
      "To make your webinar presentation you should choose a presentation tool that integrates with your webinar platform. Keep your slides simple and visual.\n",
      "To create a webinar be sure to brief your speakers and moderator and test all your software and hardware ahead of time. Remember to segment your mailing list and leverage online communities to promote the event.\n",
      "To host a webinar try to be the first one there and be ready to use interactive elements like live polls, CTA buttons, and the Q&A feature.\n",

Livestorm also comes with a packed set of engagement tools that will help you keep your audience attentive before, during, and after your webinar.\n",
      "What do you say as a host in a webinar?\n",
      "As the webinar host, you should welcome your audience and your speakers. You can also invite attendees to interact with you or the presenter and ask questions, invite the speaker to stage or present the topic, and ask for feedback.\n",
      "How can I host a webinar for free?\n",
      "To host a webinar for free, you need to use the free version of a webinar platform like Livestorm. Livestorm’s free plan is a great place to start because it will always be free - not just for a trial period.\n",

Download nowYou're getting ready to host a webinar and you want to get it right. But what to do if you have connectivity issues? Or your audience gets bored in the first 10 minutes? No worries, we've got you covered.\n",
      "Being a webinar host sounds like a big responsibility, and while you shouldn’t take it lightly, you don’t have to do it all by yourself. You can get a moderator, an assistant, and a speaker to help out.\n",
      "In this article, we’ll explain which responsibilities fall on your plate and how to plan everything from idea generation to the wrap-up. You’ll also find a few tips from Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm, and insights from our user’s webinar statistics.\n",
      "Download the Ebook to learn how to boost webinar registrationsEbooksWebinar Promotion HandbookEverything you need to promote your webinars and increase attendance.Download What is a webinar host?\n",
      "A webinar host is the person in charge of running a webinar. As a host, you’re generally responsible for starting the event, introducing any speakers, and leading a live Q&A at the end.\n",
      "A host can sometimes be referred to as the “master of ceremony” or “MC”. That’s because they’re responsible for guiding the audience through the webinar experience, but aren’t necessarily same person as the keynote speaker.\n",
      "What’s the role of a webinar host?\n",
      "The role of a webinar host is to ensure the guest speakers and audience are looked after throughout the event and that everything runs smoothly. Sometimes, the host has a few backstage responsibilities too, like putting together a presentation or showing speakers how to use the webinar platform. As a host, you need to:\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "The webinar host is usually an unofficial brand ambassador. You’re responsible for ensuring all the content follows your brand guidelines and meets the objectives of the webinar. As a master of ceremony, you also need to embody the company’s values and brand voice.\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "The host is not necessarily the person that will lead the webinar from start to finish; rather, the one who will manage the flow of the event. This person usually welcomes everyone to the virtual room and explains the rules and online event agenda.\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "During the welcome segment, the host is responsible for pointing out some of the engagement functions of the webinar software. You can explain how to:\n",
      "Use the Q&A tab\n",
      "Vote on polls\n",
      "Interact on a virtual whiteboard\n",
      "Request to go on stage\n",
      "React using emojis\n",
      "Analyze your dataAnalyze all of your data with Livestorm's powerful reporting features.Sign up for free Introduce speakers\n",
      "Another crucial role of the host is to invite the speakers onstage and introduce them one by one. Make sure you ask the speakers for a short bio and adjust it for the webinar presentation.\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "As a host, you also need to brush up on the subject matter. That way, you can help smooth the conversation flow or continue the presentation if the speakers have trouble with their internet connection.\n",
      "EbooksWebinar Promotion HandbookEverything you need to promote your webinars and increase attendance.Download How to conduct a successful webinar\n",
      "To host a memorable webinar, you need to follow a series of steps before, during, and after the session. While online events are all different, you can turn this list into a step-by-step project plan or Gantt chart template and use it for future webinars. Focus on these areas to host a successful webinar:\n",
      "Planning the session\n",

      "Engaging the audience\n",
      "Ending the call\n",
      "If you want to see a summarized version of the steps, check out this video from our Content Manager, Daniella.\n",
      "How to plan a webinar\n",
      "When planning a webinar, there are two main things to consider: the audience and your virtual event platform. All the steps listed will revolve around these two areas. Here’s how to plan a webinar:\n",
      "Choose a topic\n",
      "Get to know your platform\n",
      "Pick a format\n",
      "Assign roles\n",
      "Set a date and time\n",
      "Build a registration page\n",
      "Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "1. Choose a webinar topic\n",
      "The first step is to pick a topic. Use tools like Answer The Public or Also Asked to see what your audience is searching for online. Make sure you decide on a topic that relates to your brand and where you have some level of expertise.\n",
      "2. Get to know your webinar platform\n",
      "Next, get familiar with your company's webinar platform. Experiment with it, set up a call with yourself or teammates, and test the features. Some people recommend doing this later in the process, but we suggest you do this early on so you can plan engagement activities around what the tool offers and what you can do with it.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, you can get familiar with the platform by hosting regular team meetings and using engagement functionalities like:\n",
      "Q&A tab\n",
      "CTA buttons\n",
      "Breakout rooms\n",
      "Polls\n",
      "3. Pick a webinar format\n",
      "After you’ve discovered everything you can do with your webinar platform, define the format. You can choose from:\n",
      "Panel discussions. This means inviting 3-5 people onstage to discuss a set of predetermined questions on a topic.\n",
      "Ask me anything or Q&As. This format usually involves the host answering audience inquiries. With Livestorm, you can easily invite people on stage and allow them to unmute themselves and ask questions.\n",
      "Regular presentations. This is when you invite an expert speaker to run a presentation on a topic using a slide deck.\n",
      "Interviews or press conferences. This format is a bit less common for webinars, but you can invite a popular speaker and allow the audience to ask questions. It’s different from a Q&A session because you get to use the content for public sharing, such as a written press release.\n",
      "On-demand webinars. This is just like a regular webinar except you don’t need to be physically present. Use an on-demand webinar platform like Livestorm to pre-record your webinar and set up automations to host the event without any live intervention. Or, simply upload it to your website as gated content to generate leads whenever it gets downloaded.\n",
      "4. Assign roles\n",
      "Choose your webinar A-team and assign them responsibilities, such as:\n",
      "Speaker or trainer to deliver educational content\n",
      "Moderator to manage the backstage, encourage conversation in the chat tab, filter questions, and monitor audio and video quality\n",
      "Assistant to help the moderator and cover for them in case of emergencies\n",
      "Host or organizer to plan and lead the webinar from start to finish and ensure both the speakers and audience are looked after\n",
      "\"It's handy to have the moderator chat feature, especially when you have a lot of speakers. That way you can ping them and ask 'can we speed it up?' or whatever” said Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm. “You can send notes that are only in the moderator chat and not public to the webinar attendees.\"\n",
      "5. Set a date and time\n",
      "It’s not an event until you’ve set a date and time! Coordinate with your team to find a slot that works best for all of you.\n",
      "Our webinar statistics show that the best days to host events are Wednesdays and Thursdays. That said, every audience is different so you could run a quick, informal survey to see when yours are most likely to join.\n",
      "Pro tip: You can use software like Typeform to create surveys and find your target audience’s primary time zone. Post on social media to reach them or, depending on your survey software, pay to get answers from your target audience.\n",
      "6. Build a registration page\n",
      "Before promoting a webinar, you need a landing page to collect attendee registration. If you’re using Livestorm, you get access to an automatically generated webinar registration page as soon as you schedule your meeting. You can customize the colors and fonts to match your branding, add custom fields to the form, and set a registration limit.\n",
      "Customize registration pagesCreate and customize registration pages that are optimized for conversionSign up for free 7. Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "Your webinar needs an audience and it’s your job to:\n",
      "Come up with a catchy webinar title\n",
      "Capture the attention of potential attendees\n",
      "Explore topics that interest your target audience\n",
      "Invite them to register\n",
      "Keep them engaged with your brand before, during, and after the event\n",
      "To achieve this, you have to create a marketing plan to promote your webinar. Include the type of content, timeline, and media outlets. A common strategy is to use a combination of organic social media and paid ads for a month for better reach and conversions.\n",
      "Pro tip: According to our stats on webinar marketing, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the best days to send out invitations to your event.\n",
      "How to structure a webinar presentation\n",
      "It’s among webinar best practices to create a structured and attention-grabbing presentation. To do so, follow these steps:\n",
      "Create an outline\n",
      "Define your agenda\n",
      "Include visuals\n",
      "Plan for engagement\n",
      "1. Create an outline\n",
      "Avoid being 40 slides in and not even close to finishing on time by creating a skeleton of your presentation first. This will help determine the length of your presentation and keep your thoughts organized. It also shows you where you can plan engaging activities for your talk.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, create your presentation directly on Visme, and include a short description on each slide. Then, use the app integration to share your presentation, skip, and click on your slides directly from the webinar tab.\n",
      "2. Define your agenda\n",
      "Creating an outline will practically write the agenda for you: make a list of the content on each slide and add it to the beginning of the presentation. A good agenda will help you keep to time, especially if your webinar moderator is given an estimate per item.\n",
      "\"The biggest challenge for keeping an audience engaged is keeping track of time and making sure that the speakers don't go over,” explained Pauline. “Sometimes they get off track. So, it's about making that choice: do I refocus the conversation or do I cut some of these questions?\"\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm or Zoom, you chat with your moderator through a private in-app tab that the public can’t see. That way, if you’re running out of time or decide to skip questions to move the webinar along, you can communicate with each other easily.\n",
      "3. Include visuals\n",
      "Avoid creating a slide deck that’s filled with long blocks of text. Remember, you’re not creating an e-book, you’re designing visual aid to make your webinar more engaging. Add pictures, videos, and gifs to make it more dynamic and eye-catching.\n",
      "Pro tip: Use contrasting colors (opposites in the chromatic circle) or a lighter shade to make some sentences stand out.\n",
      "4. Plan for engagement\n",
      "Sometimes you book a speaker who looks good on paper but ends up delivering a boring talk anyway. Before the webinar, chat about their presentation and make sure they know how to make the most of the platform's engagement features. Suggest they plan ahead for interactive elements, like using Miro’s digital whiteboard to take suggestions from the audience or sharing additional resources as they go using the Livestorm Handouts plugin.\n",
      "How to start a webinar\n",
      "Welcoming your audience is also about setting them up for success. Kick off the call by explaining the ground rules and the meeting agenda. Do it in this order:\n",
      "Welcome your audience\n",
      "Set ground rules\n",
      "Share agenda points\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "1. Welcome your audience\n",
      "Start the webinar with your camera on, but don’t share your screen yet. When it’s time to start the presentation, unmute yourself, and welcome everyone for joining. If you’re waiting for more people to join, announce that you’ll wait for 3 minutes before you begin, but don’t stay silent – e.g. ask people where they’re joining from.\n",
      "2. Set ground rules\n",
      "Say hello to the ones who joined a bit late and explain basic ground rules:\n",
      "Is this a camera on or off type of session?\n",
      "When and how to ask questions\n",
      "How long will it last?\n",
      "Do they need to take notes or are you sharing the information?\n",
      "Remind everyone to be kind and respectful\n",
      "Open the floor for questions before moving on to the next slide.\n",
      "3. Share agenda points\n",
      "Give your audience an overview of what to expect from the session, including details of any comfort breaks. You can also take this opportunity to point out features like the Q&A tab, emoji reactions, and the “raise a hand” feature to help them navigate the webinar platform.\n",
      "4. Introduce other speakers\n",
      "Introduce the guest speaker(s) and invite them on stage. Make sure you pronounce their names properly and give an accurate professional description. Explain your role and cede the floor.\n",
      "How to keep your audience engaged during a webinar\n",
      "Engaging a virtual audience during live webinars might sound like a tough gig, but it’s definitely possible. Here’s what you need to do:\n",
      "Conduct live polls\n",

      "1. Conduct live polls\n",
      "Keeping your audience engaged can be as simple as asking questions to include them in the conversation. Use the polls feature – almost all the best webinar platforms have one – to ask questions with multiple-choice answers.\n",
      "For example, you can use polls to introduce surprising facts and gauge your audience's pre-existing knowledge of the topic. Or just bring one in to break the ice by asking questions like \"How energized are you feeling today?\" (more on that below).\n",
      "2. Open with an icebreaker\n",
      "Depending on the type of webinar, you can play an icebreaker with the speakers or the audience. “You can use an icebreaker that’s completely linked to the topic so you can ask the panelists,” explains Pauline. “For other webinars, I’d host the icebreaker with the audience. I can ask where they are tuned in from or if there is anything specific they want to hear.”\n",
      "You can find hundreds of icebreaker ideas online. Pick one that’ll take no longer than 3 minutes and invite your audience to participate. Try this: share a meme of a TV character making different faces using a digital whiteboard. Ask attendees to add a post-it on top of the picture they feel is the most relatable.\n",
      "3. Play a game throughout the webinar\n",
      "Explain the game at the beginning of the webinar and play it throughout the presentation. For example, you can hide an emoji in specific slides and get attendees to use Livestorm’s emoji reactions to notify you when they find it. Inviting your audience to play a game with you builds a sense of camaraderie. Plus, it encourages them to pay more attention as they might lose the game if they get distracted.\n",

No worries, we've got you covered.\n",
      "Being a webinar host sounds like a big responsibility, and while you shouldn’t take it lightly, you don’t have to do it all by yourself. You can get a moderator, an assistant, and a speaker to help out.\n",
      "In this article, we’ll explain which responsibilities fall on your plate and how to plan everything from idea generation to the wrap-up. You’ll also find a few tips from Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm, and insights from our user’s webinar statistics.\n",
      "Download the Ebook to learn how to boost webinar registrationsEbooksWebinar Promotion HandbookEverything you need to promote your webinars and increase attendance.Download What is a webinar host?\n",
      "A webinar host is the person in charge of running a webinar. As a host, you’re generally responsible for starting the event, introducing any speakers, and leading a live Q&A at the end.\n",
      "A host can sometimes be referred to as the “master of ceremony” or “MC”. That’s because they’re responsible for guiding the audience through the webinar experience, but aren’t necessarily same person as the keynote speaker.\n",
      "What’s the role of a webinar host?\n",
      "The role of a webinar host is to ensure the guest speakers and audience are looked after throughout the event and that everything runs smoothly. Sometimes, the host has a few backstage responsibilities too, like putting together a presentation or showing speakers how to use the webinar platform. As a host, you need to:\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "Represent the brand\n",
      "The webinar host is usually an unofficial brand ambassador. You’re responsible for ensuring all the content follows your brand guidelines and meets the objectives of the webinar. As a master of ceremony, you also need to embody the company’s values and brand voice.\n",
      "Welcome the audience\n",
      "The host is not necessarily the person that will lead the webinar from start to finish; rather, the one who will manage the flow of the event. This person usually welcomes everyone to the virtual room and explains the rules and online event agenda.\n",
      "Point out useful features\n",
      "During the welcome segment, the host is responsible for pointing out some of the engagement functions of the webinar software. You can explain how to:\n",
      "Use the Q&A tab\n",
      "Vote on polls\n",
      "Interact on a virtual whiteboard\n",
      "Request to go on stage\n",
      "React using emojis\n",
      "Analyze your dataAnalyze all of your data with Livestorm's powerful reporting features.Sign up for free Introduce speakers\n",
      "Another crucial role of the host is to invite the speakers onstage and introduce them one by one. Make sure you ask the speakers for a short bio and adjust it for the webinar presentation.\n",
      "Guide the discussion\n",
      "As a host, you also need to brush up on the subject matter. That way, you can help smooth the conversation flow or continue the presentation if the speakers have trouble with their internet connection.\n",

      "To host a memorable webinar, you need to follow a series of steps before, during, and after the session. While online events are all different, you can turn this list into a step-by-step project plan or Gantt chart template and use it for future webinars. Focus on these areas to host a successful webinar:\n",

      "Ending the call\n",
      "If you want to see a summarized version of the steps, check out this video from our Content Manager, Daniella.\n",
      "How to plan a webinar\n",
      "When planning a webinar, there are two main things to consider: the audience and your virtual event platform. All the steps listed will revolve around these two areas. Here’s how to plan a webinar:\n",
      "Choose a topic\n",
      "Get to know your platform\n",
      "Pick a format\n",
      "Assign roles\n",
      "Set a date and time\n",
      "Build a registration page\n",
      "Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "1. Choose a webinar topic\n",
      "The first step is to pick a topic. Use tools like Answer The Public or Also Asked to see what your audience is searching for online. Make sure you decide on a topic that relates to your brand and where you have some level of expertise.\n",
      "2. Get to know your webinar platform\n",
      "Next, get familiar with your company's webinar platform. Experiment with it, set up a call with yourself or teammates, and test the features. Some people recommend doing this later in the process, but we suggest you do this early on so you can plan engagement activities around what the tool offers and what you can do with it.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, you can get familiar with the platform by hosting regular team meetings and using engagement functionalities like:\n",
      "Q&A tab\n",
      "CTA buttons\n",
      "Breakout rooms\n",
      "Polls\n",
      "3. Pick a webinar format\n",
      "After you’ve discovered everything you can do with your webinar platform, define the format. You can choose from:\n",
      "Panel discussions. This means inviting 3-5 people onstage to discuss a set of predetermined questions on a topic.\n",
      "Ask me anything or Q&As. This format usually involves the host answering audience inquiries. With Livestorm, you can easily invite people on stage and allow them to unmute themselves and ask questions.\n",
      "Regular presentations. This is when you invite an expert speaker to run a presentation on a topic using a slide deck.\n",
      "Interviews or press conferences. This format is a bit less common for webinars, but you can invite a popular speaker and allow the audience to ask questions. It’s different from a Q&A session because you get to use the content for public sharing, such as a written press release.\n",
      "On-demand webinars. This is just like a regular webinar except you don’t need to be physically present. Use an on-demand webinar platform like Livestorm to pre-record your webinar and set up automations to host the event without any live intervention. Or, simply upload it to your website as gated content to generate leads whenever it gets downloaded.\n",
      "4. Assign roles\n",
      "Choose your webinar A-team and assign them responsibilities, such as:\n",
      "Speaker or trainer to deliver educational content\n",
      "Moderator to manage the backstage, encourage conversation in the chat tab, filter questions, and monitor audio and video quality\n",
      "Assistant to help the moderator and cover for them in case of emergencies\n",
      "Host or organizer to plan and lead the webinar from start to finish and ensure both the speakers and audience are looked after\n",
      "\"It's handy to have the moderator chat feature, especially when you have a lot of speakers. That way you can ping them and ask 'can we speed it up?' or whatever” said Pauline Mura, Partnership Marketing Manager at Livestorm. “You can send notes that are only in the moderator chat and not public to the webinar attendees.\"\n",
      "5. Set a date and time\n",
      "It’s not an event until you’ve set a date and time! Coordinate with your team to find a slot that works best for all of you.\n",
      "Our webinar statistics show that the best days to host events are Wednesdays and Thursdays. That said, every audience is different so you could run a quick, informal survey to see when yours are most likely to join.\n",
      "Pro tip: You can use software like Typeform to create surveys and find your target audience’s primary time zone. Post on social media to reach them or, depending on your survey software, pay to get answers from your target audience.\n",
      "6. Build a registration page\n",
      "Before promoting a webinar, you need a landing page to collect attendee registration. If you’re using Livestorm, you get access to an automatically generated webinar registration page as soon as you schedule your meeting. You can customize the colors and fonts to match your branding, add custom fields to the form, and set a registration limit.\n",
      "Customize registration pagesCreate and customize registration pages that are optimized for conversionSign up for free 7. Come up with a promotion plan\n",
      "Your webinar needs an audience and it’s your job to:\n",
      "Come up with a catchy webinar title\n",
      "Capture the attention of potential attendees\n",
      "Explore topics that interest your target audience\n",
      "Invite them to register\n",
      "Keep them engaged with your brand before, during, and after the event\n",
      "To achieve this, you have to create a marketing plan to promote your webinar. Include the type of content, timeline, and media outlets. A common strategy is to use a combination of organic social media and paid ads for a month for better reach and conversions.\n",
      "Pro tip: According to our stats on webinar marketing, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the best days to send out invitations to your event.\n",
      "How to structure a webinar presentation\n",
      "It’s among webinar best practices to create a structured and attention-grabbing presentation. To do so, follow these steps:\n",
      "Create an outline\n",
      "Define your agenda\n",
      "Include visuals\n",
      "Plan for engagement\n",
      "1. Create an outline\n",
      "Avoid being 40 slides in and not even close to finishing on time by creating a skeleton of your presentation first. This will help determine the length of your presentation and keep your thoughts organized. It also shows you where you can plan engaging activities for your talk.\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm, create your presentation directly on Visme, and include a short description on each slide. Then, use the app integration to share your presentation, skip, and click on your slides directly from the webinar tab.\n",
      "2. Define your agenda\n",
      "Creating an outline will practically write the agenda for you: make a list of the content on each slide and add it to the beginning of the presentation. A good agenda will help you keep to time, especially if your webinar moderator is given an estimate per item.\n",
      "\"The biggest challenge for keeping an audience engaged is keeping track of time and making sure that the speakers don't go over,” explained Pauline. “Sometimes they get off track. So, it's about making that choice: do I refocus the conversation or do I cut some of these questions?\"\n",
      "If you’re using Livestorm or Zoom, you chat with your moderator through a private in-app tab that the public can’t see. That way, if you’re running out of time or decide to skip questions to move the webinar along, you can communicate with each other easily.\n",
      "3. Include visuals\n",
      "Avoid creating a slide deck that’s filled with long blocks of text. Remember, you’re not creating an e-book, you’re designing visual aid to make your webinar more engaging. Add pictures, videos, and gifs to make it more dynamic and eye-catching.\n",
      "Pro tip: Use contrasting colors (opposites in the chromatic circle) or a lighter shade to make some sentences stand out.\n",
      "4. Plan for engagement\n",
      "Sometimes you book a speaker who looks good on paper but ends up delivering a boring talk anyway. Before the webinar, chat about their presentation and make sure they know how to make the most of the platform's engagement features. Suggest they plan ahead for interactive elements, like using Miro’s digital whiteboard to take suggestions from the audience or sharing additional resources as they go using the Livestorm Handouts plugin.\n",
      "How to start a webinar\n",
      "Welcoming your audience is also about setting them up for success. Kick off the call by explaining the ground rules and the meeting agenda. Do it in this order:\n",
      "Welcome your audience\n",
      "Set ground rules\n",
      "Share agenda points\n",
      "Introduce speakers\n",
      "1. Welcome your audience\n",
      "Start the webinar with your camera on, but don’t share your screen yet. When it’s time to start the presentation, unmute yourself, and welcome everyone for joining. If you’re waiting for more people to join, announce that you’ll wait for 3 minutes before you begin, but don’t stay silent – e.g. ask people where they’re joining from.\n",
      "2. Set ground rules\n",
      "Say hello to the ones who joined a bit late and explain basic ground rules:\n",
      "Is this a camera on or off type of session?\n",
      "When and how to ask questions\n",
      "How long will it last?\n",
      "Do they need to take notes or are you sharing the information?\n",
      "Remind everyone to be kind and respectful\n",
      "Open the floor for questions before moving on to the next slide.\n",
      "3. Share agenda points\n",
      "Give your audience an overview of what to expect from the session, including details of any comfort breaks. You can also take this opportunity to point out features like the Q&A tab, emoji reactions, and the “raise a hand” feature to help them navigate the webinar platform.\n",
      "4. Introduce other speakers\n",
      "Introduce the guest speaker(s) and invite them on stage. Make sure you pronounce their names properly and give an accurate professional description. Explain your role and cede the floor.\n",
      "How to keep your audience engaged during a webinar\n",
      "Engaging a virtual audience during live webinars might sound like a tough gig, but it’s definitely possible. Here’s what you need to do:\n",
      "Conduct live polls\n",
      "Open with an icebreaker\n",
      "Play a game throughout the webinar\n",
      "Run Q&A sessions\n",

Recent research shows email marketing converts recipients to leads at a rate of 2.9%. This is very impressive compared to 1.45% for organic search traffic, and social media's 1.22% conversion ratio. Tech companies can use a wide range of inbound marketing strategies to generate leads and grow their companies - but none has a higher lead conversion rate than email marketing.Tech companies can use a wide range of inbound marketing strategies to generate leads and grow their companies - but none has a higher lead conversion rate than email marketing.According to recent research, email marketing converts recipients to leads at a rate of 2.9%.This is very impressive compared to 1.45% for organic search traffic, and social media's 1.22% conversion ratio.Clearly, there's a huge opportunity for growth here. Technology companies with a strong email marketing strategy can use email as a powerful tool to nurture prospects, increase sales, and further relationships. Read on to discover the ultimate email marketing guide for technology products so you can leverage the power of emails to get you the results you want.1. Define Your Target AudienceIf you don't know who your ideal audience is, you'll find it hard to build a list of engaged email subscribers. Take the time to define your target audience - either from your existing data or by doing the research from scratch.  Keep in mind that your targeted audience might change depending on the type of email campaign you are running. You need a targeted demographic for every marketing effort you make, so think through the specific list or segment your campaign is aimed at before proceeding with the rest of the steps.2. Trade Your Best Content for Email AddressesYour next step is to audit your assets and choose or develop content that you can then trade for your audience’s emails. If you've been in business for any length of time, you likely already have a massive selection of content assets in your library. You can choose the best content pieces that are most likely to capture your ideal audience’s interest and drive downloads. Alternatively, you can develop new content assets to meet the needs of your email marketing campaign.For instance, say your company offers cloud storage for enterprise businesses. You might build an online course explaining how to use your product, post it on your site, and then restrict access to the course until after a website visitor enters their contact information. Once they've done that, you can then automatically add them to your mailing list.3. Personalize the Signup ProcessThese days, consumers expect brands to deliver relevant content, products, and services. This goes for EVERY aspect of marketing - including emails. That's why it's more important than ever to focus on personalizing the email sign-up process. It will help you segment your audience from day one. An easy way to do this is by including optional personalization questions on your sign-up form.For instance, if your tech company is focused on some type of localized job search, one of the questions on your opt-in form might be \"What industry are you interested in working in?\"Depending on the new subscriber’s answer, you can then create a personalized email campaign with content and offers that are relevant to different individuals.Pro Tip: Add questions to your “Welcome” email.You can also add questions to the welcome email that you send out soon after someone signs up for your list. This has the added benefit of assuring your customers that you are committed to personalizing their experience and providing them with the most relevant content and products. You can then use the answers to your questions as a way to segment them into appropriate lists.4. Send the Right Types of EmailsThere are many different ways you can use emails in your tech company. For instance, you might send emails to:Welcome your subscribers;Thank them for downloading your content;Share company news;Direct them to a new blog/social media post;Invite them to a webinar, virtual conference, or other events;Or to simply ask how things are going.The types of emails you send will depend on who your customer is, and where they are in the customer sales process. This means you have to properly segment your subscriber list AND personalize the emails you send so they can be more relevant to recipients.The key here is to create a compelling experience with each email you send. Whatever your goal is, you need to focus on getting subscribers to take the desired action5. Send Emails at Optimal TimesJust as there are different emails to send in different situations, there’s a right time to send each email. Studies show that there’s an optimal time for sending emails in the tech industry. But, rather than infer general trends from best practices and big data, it's always a good idea to conduct your own research to find the day, time, and frequency that is ideal for your own audience.Keep in mind that you must plan your emails so their timing is aligned with your subscriber’s place in the sales journey. Regardless of optimal sending times, you shouldn't be sending the same email to someone who just purchased your product and someone else's been using it for months. So make sure that your email progression should take into account where new sign-ups are in comparison to subscribers who have been on your list for weeks, months, or years. 6. Use Automation to Improve EfficiencyMarketing automation is crucial for companies in the tech industry to stay on top of, contact, and nurture their leads. You need to choose the right marketing automation tool that will help you improve efficiency and build a predictable and sustainable revenue model.Luckily, there are A LOT of tools and automated systems available today to help you collect leads, build a marketing pipeline, segment contacts, and market to them consistently (and intelligently).Examples of marketing automation tools that can help you accomplish more in less time include Hubspot, Eloqua, and Marketo.SourceReliable marketing automation is something that is particularly important in the technology space.That’s because sales and presales cycles can last weeks or months (sometimes even years). You need a marketing automation tool that will help you in nurturing, qualifying, and passing leads over to sales once they are finally ready.The best tools will also help you gather data on subscriber behavior so you can build stronger email marketing campaigns.7. Monitor PerformanceThe final step in creating a successful email marketing campaign is to track and monitor your performance so you can find ways to improve your results.Keep track of the important email marketing metrics like:Open RatesClick-through RatesConversion RateUnsubscribe RatesReturn on Investment (ROI)This will help you identify any strategies that may be holding you back so you can make the necessary changes to increase your success.The best email marketing platforms today come with insight and reporting features that make it easy to understand how the different aspects of your campaign are performing so you can continually optimize your email program.You can compare your metrics to industry benchmarks, like the ones in the example below:SourceIf you find your campaign falling short, you can then take the necessary steps to improve your results (such as removing non-engaged contacts from your opt-in list).  It’s recommended to use environmental scanning to look at your business holistically and understand if the issues are tied only to your email, or the way in which you depict your company publicly.And don’t be afraid to experiment.Trial and error through A/B testing different aspects of your emails will help you find ways to get the best return on your email program. Examples of Highly Engaging Emails from Tech CompaniesBelow are a few examples from some of the top tech companies. Use them as inspiration to help you develop your own highly engaging emails.Example #1: Domain and Web Hosting ServicesSourceExample #2: ECommerce StoreSourceExample #3: Graphic Design and Web DevelopmentSourceTips to Grow Your Email ListTip #1: Send super-personalized video emails that are guaranteed to increase your response rates SourceTip #2: Choose responsive email templates with high deliverability.

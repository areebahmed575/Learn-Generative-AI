It is a plain C/C++ implementation optimized for Apple silicon and x86 architectures, supporting various integer quantization and BLAS libraries. Originally a web chat example, it now serves as a development playground for ggml library features.\n","\n","`GGML`, a C library for machine learning, facilitates the distribution of large language models (LLMs). It utilizes quantization to enable efficient LLM execution on consumer hardware. GGML files contain binary-encoded data, including version number, hyperparameters, vocabulary, and weights.

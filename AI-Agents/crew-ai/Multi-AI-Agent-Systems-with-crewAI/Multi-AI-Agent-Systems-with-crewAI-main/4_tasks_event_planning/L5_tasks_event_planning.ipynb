      "We will take away any back of house compost and leftover food on full service events at no cost. If you need us to take the trash off-site there is an additional fee that varies by the size of the event.\n",
      "How far do you travel?\n",
      "We operate in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, however we are able to travel up to 75 miles outside the city with appropriate travel fees applied.\n",
      "How much advance notice do you need for events?\n",
      "We require two weeks advance notice to properly prepare for your event. This gives us the time needed to create your menu and proposal, schedule a site visit, order the rentals and linen and staff the event.\n",
      "Do you require a deposit to hold the date?\n",
      "Yes, in order to secure the date we require a signed contract and a 50% deposit.\n",
      "When do you require a final guest count?\n",
      "We require 10 days advanced notice. Events over $20,000 require 14 days advance notice.\n",
      "When do I need to finalize any menu changes?\n",
      "10 days prior to the event date. For events over $20,000, 30 days prior to the event date.\n",
      "Do you provide tastings?\n",
      "Yes, we are happy to offer our clients a tasting for events over $10k once you have received a proposal.  We charge $500 for a group of 4 people per guest, which is applied towards the balance with a signed contract.\n",
      "Are you a certified green business?\n",
      " Yes!  Our principles, policies and practices aim to improve the quality of life and create  a positive effect for our customers, employees, communities, and the planet.\n",
      " How long have you been around?\n",
      " Left Coast Catering got its start working in the Silicon Valley in 1994 catering private dinners for some of the top executives. Since then we have grown into a full service catering company that has accommodated events of up to 1,500 guests.\n",
      " What is the production charge?\n",
      "The 18% is based on the event subtotal. The \"production, administrative and insurance\" charge helps to pay for staff that handle all aspects of our business that are not at your event, (both administrative and kitchen), and the many types of insurance we are required to hold. It is a standard for most caterers to include with their proposals, but many caterers refer to it simply as a \"service charge\"\n",
      "Why is there tax on everything?\n",
      "California Board of Equalization requires sales tax on all services.\n",
      "What is your cancellation policy?\n",
      "If you cancel your event after the date is booked (proposal is accepted and a date is reserved) there will be a cancellation fee  due based on the date of cancellation as follows:\n",
      "Cancellation one month or more prior to the event, a 20% cancellation fee plus any costs incurred\n",
      "Cancellation within two weeks prior to the event, a 50% cancellation fee plus any costs incurred\n",
      "Cancellation within seven business days prior to the event, payment is due in full\n",
      "What forms of payment do you accept?\n",
      "We accept all major credit cards, personal checks and ACH transfers\n",
      "How does billing work?\n",
      "We require a 50% deposit, a credit card on file and a signed contract in order to save the date. Final balance is due the day of the event. We accept all major credit cards, checks, and cash.\n",
      "Are you fully insured?\n",
      "We carry 2 million dollars of liability insurance and workman's compensation Give us a call to discuss your event.\n",

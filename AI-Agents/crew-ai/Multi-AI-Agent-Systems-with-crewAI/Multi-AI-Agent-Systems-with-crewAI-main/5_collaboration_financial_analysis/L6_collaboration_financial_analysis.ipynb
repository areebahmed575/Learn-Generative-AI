    "### Multi-agent collaboration techniques\n",
    "In CrewAI, there are several multi-agent collaboration techniques, each designed to facilitate different kinds of interactions and workflows among agents. Here’s an overview of the main techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: In this process, tasks are executed one after another in a defined sequence. Each agent completes its assigned task before the next agent begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: This technique is ideal for scenarios where the output of one task is necessary for the next, ensuring a step-by-step progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallel Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Here, multiple agents work on their tasks simultaneously. This process is used when tasks are independent of each other and can be executed in parallel without dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Suitable for increasing efficiency by leveraging multiple agents at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Process: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: In a hierarchical process, agents are organized in a hierarchy where higher-level agents(Manager) can delegate tasks to lower-level agents. This allows for a top-down management structure within the crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Best used in complex projects where tasks need to be broken down into sub-tasks and managed by different levels of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collaboration with Memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: This technique allows agents to share a collective memory, enabling them to access and build on each other's work. Memory can be used to store intermediate results, decisions, and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Ideal for ongoing projects where context and past decisions need to be considered in future tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kickoff Async:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: This method allows tasks to be kicked off asynchronously, meaning agents can start working on their tasks at different times, not necessarily in a strict sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Useful in dynamic environments where tasks may start at different times based on the availability of data or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kickoff for Each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: This is used to kickoff tasks for each agent in a crew, ensuring that all agents start their tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where all agents need to work simultaneously on different aspects of a project."

      " Apple Stock: 3 Simple Day Trading Strategies Aug 5, 2018 Written by: Al Hill Apple Inc, trading on the NASDAQ exchange is one of the most popular stocks preferred by both intraday traders and long term investors. Investors flock to APPL stock for a number of reasons ranging from its high liquidity to its market capitalization and the strong fundamentals.\n",
      "Apple Inc. set a new record of sorts as it created history with a market capitalization of one trillion U.S. dollars. The only other company to hit a one trillion market capitalization was PetroChina which briefly hit the milestone in 2007.\n",
      "There is no wonder then that the stock is loved by speculators and short-term traders. There are many reasons, which also include the liquidity and the volatility of the stock.\n",
      "A stock with good intraday liquidity has many advantages. For one, the spread, which is the difference between the bid and ask price is tight, making it cheaper to speculate or day trade. The daily high average volume also means that the fills are tight.\n",
      "Quite often, one can see that the price you bid for is not always the price you get. In the case of Apple’s stock, however, you can easily see that the price quotes are much tighter.\n",
      "With a lot of news keeping the markets busy, trading Apple’s stock can certainly be a safe bet for intraday traders.\n",
      "In this article, we walk you through three simple trading strategies that you can employ for day trading Apple stock. The indicators used throughout the different strategies are also commonly available. This means that you can easily use the Apple stock tips for day trading on almost any trading platform.\n",
      "Trading 2 Day Highs/Lows\n",
      "The two-day high low strategy is ideal for short-term speculative trading or day traders. In this trading strategy, the basic premise is to buy the breakout from the two-day high or to sell the break down off a two-day low.\n",
      "Traders can make quick profits using this strategy but it requires preparation ahead of the market open. It is also ideal to use this strategy during days when there are no major news events. This includes any events such as earnings releases or major events in the sector.\n",
      "The two-day high-low trading strategy for Apple stock is purely a technical play on the stock. Sometimes, the fundamentals could potentially help to increase the profits as well.\n",
      "The first step in the two-day high low trading method, as the name suggests is to identify a two-day high and low. The easy way to start is to look for the high and the low from the previous two days, ahead of the opening bell.\n",
      "It also helps to keep track of the pre-market open. As long as the stock isn’t making any big moves, it would be safe to trade. After plotting the high and the low, switch to a 5-minute chart. Now simply wait for the first 5-minute session to post a close outside the two-day high or the two-day low.\n",
      "Initiate a long or a short position accordingly at the start of the next 5-minute session. To protect your trade, place the stops at the previous 5-minute session’s low. Aim for a partial close based on the risk taken and move the remaining position to break even.\n",
      "For the remainder of the trade, aim for a 1:2 risk/reward ratio or look to close the trade at the nearest round number.\n",
      "Two day high low – Trade example\n",
      "The chart below illustrates the two-day high-low trading strategy. The rectangle area marks the two-day high and low levels. Following the high and the low that is formed, you simply wait for the first bullish 5-minute session to close outside the two-day high or low.\n",
      "Once you find the setup, either long or short the trade with the stops placed at the previous lows.\n",
      "Two-day high low trading strategy\n",
      "While the strategy looks simple enough on paper, in practice it requires the trader to keep watching the charts. Sometimes, you can expect price action to continue to range with the breakout happening later in the day. On other days, you can expect to see a major move occurring within the first hour of trading itself.\n",
      "Therefore, it is essential to prepare ahead of the opening bell and also to ensure that there is no major market-moving events.\n",
      "Trading ranges during low volatility\n",
      "Trading ranges during periods of low volatility can ensure trades steady profits despite the stock heading nowhere. However, the downside to this method is that there is a risk of being caught up in fake moves. This strategy requires a bit of practice and skill.\n",
      "Trading during low volatility means that price action is essentially moving sideways. While long or even medium-term traders tend to avoid this, scaling down to the smaller time frame charts can help.\n",
      "In this trading strategy, you can make use of any oscillator that can help you to identify overbought and oversold levels. The settings for the oscillator also need to be set to a short-term setting in order to be very sensitive to the price action.\n",
      "While there are many different oscillators one can use, the most common ones include the relative strength index (RSI), Stochastics, or the Rate of Change oscillator. Of course, you are free to experiment with other oscillators as well as their settings.\n",
      "Once you set up the oscillator, the next step is to change the settings so that it is sensitive to the price movements. You can tweak the oscillator’s overbought and oversold levels to capture the extremes in price action.\n",
      "By trading the ranges during low volatility, the day trader or speculator is simply capturing the short-term fluctuations in prices. Risk reward ratio in trading this strategy requires some flexibility and there are instances when you can face more losing trades as well.\n",
      "Day traders should practice this trading strategy on a trading simulator or a demo trading account before using it in the real markets. The market conditions also play a crucial role. Therefore, this strategy is not advisable during periods of high volatility.\n",
      "Trading ranges with low volatility – Trade Example\n",
      "In the below example, we use the five-minute chart. For the oscillator, we use the standard relative strength index. The RSI settings are not struck in stone. In this example, we make use of the RSI with a 7-period setting. While there is no “ideal setting” you can experiment with, find a balance between making the RSI not too sensitive and not too lagging either.\n",
      "For the overbought and oversold levels, we use the 85 and 15 levels. Every time the RSI peaks at or above 85 we go short when the indicator signals oversold levels. Likewise, when the RSI troughs at or below 15, we go long when the indicator signals overbought levels.\n",
      "You can also plot the recent pivotal high and low points on the chart.\n",
      "In the example below you can see how price posts a pivotal high. At the same time, the RSI 7 peaks near 85. You can short this position at the next session’s open, targeting the pivotal or recent low.\n",
      "Trading ranges during volatility trading strategy\n",
      "Alternately, look for the RSI 7 to drop to or at 15 and then go long on the next session’s open. You can then target the recent high to book profits.\n",
      "You can place the stops at the recent high or the low after you initiate the trade.\n",
      "GAP-FILL Strategy\n",
      "The gap-fill strategy, as the name suggests involves trading the gaps. The gap-fill strategy is a very simple approach to trading. In this strategy, day traders look for price to gap from the previous day.\n",
      "A gap in a stock’s price forms when there is a significant difference between the previous day’s close and the current day’s open. Gaps form due to pre-market activity and huge orders which bids up or down the price creating gaps.\n",
      "There is a common saying that gaps are meant to be filled. While this may be true, a gap is not always filled immediately. Gaps can also serve as support and resistance levels depending on the market conditions.\n",
      "The most common types of gaps are the common gaps, which is what we will use in this day trading strategy for Apple. Other types of gaps include the breakaway gap, continuation gaps, and exhaustion gaps.\n",
      "Gaps can also be used to understand the trends in the price chart.\n",
      "The common gap is known as such because such gaps tend to be filled quickly; in some cases during the intraday session as well.\n",
      "To trade successfully with gaps, traders need to have their charts ready at least 30-minutes before the market open. It would also help to get to know the pre-market trading price so you can anticipate if a gap will form or not.\n",
      "GAP-FILL strategy – Trade Example\n",
      "The first step is to identify the gap from the previous few days and mark the closing price with a horizontal line. The goal of the gap fill strategy is to go long when price fills the gap as it declines to the gap. For short positions, we look for price to rally to the gap before it turns around.\n",
      "Making use of a standard oscillator with intraday settings to adjust for sensitivity can help to pick better trades.\n",
      "Gap-fill trading strategy example\n",
      "In the above chart illustration, you can see that we identify the gaps from the previous days. Mark the gap with a horizontal line. We also use the RSI indicator with a 7-period setting and 85 and 15 for overbought and oversold levels.\n",
      "Now, you can see that when the price falls to the previous closing price, the RSI can determine the overbought level. In the first example, the RSI falls to 15 and then reverses. You can initiate a long position while you target the next gap.\n",
      "Price eventually rallies to this level where you can book profits. Traders need to strategically place the stops because price can tend to squeeze the position before turning around. Therefore, look to the left side of the chart and pick a price level. Alternately, since the next gap is already known, you can also set your stops based on the risk/reward ratio of 1:2.\n",
      "Once price moves in your favor, cover the stops to break even so the trade is now risk-free.\n",
      "For short positions, you can flip the strategy around. Look for price to rally to the gap and watch the RSI turn to oversold levels. At this point, you can initiate short positions based on the RSI.\n",
      "Apple day trading strategies – Recommended strategy\n",
      "The Apple day trading strategies outlined above are simple to use. Because every trader’s personality is unique, it is in your own interest to experiment with the strategies to find one that suits you best. Some traders prefer not to spend too much time on the charts, analyzing the indicators. Some traders are absolutely comfortable with chart watching.\n",
      "Between these, one can choose either the gap fill strategy which is visually easy to identify or trade the volatility breakout method.\n",
      "One of the things that is common to all the three Apple day trading strategies is that they are intraday setups. Therefore, traders can set up the charts and find a trade rather quickly. The common advantage to all the three-day trading strategies is that once you make a profit for the day, you can simply walk away.\n",
      "Overtrading, as one might already know comes from greed. Therefore, it is essential that traders maintain discipline and control when using these simple day trading strategies. Tags: \n",

It's the longest such slide for Apple since the dot-com bust of 2001.Some of Apple's troubles this year were due to a bad economic environment for phones and computers. Over the summer, total smartphone sales were the slowest in more than a decade.But Apple also dealt with some company-specific issues. Apple didn't release new iPad models in 2023, the first time that's happened in a calendar year since the product was launched in 2010. Without new models, Apple has less to promote, and older versions of the product don't see official price cuts that boost sales.Earlier this month, all current model iPads were shipping from Apple's website in a day, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. That's a sign of weak demand because with the hottest products, Apple doesn't have enough supply to ship that quickly.In fiscal 2023, which ended in September, Apple's iPad revenue dropped 3.4% to $28.3 billion. On a unit basis, iPad sales were even worse, falling 15%, according to a recent estimate from Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan. Apple doesn't report unit sales.To make matters worse, new Apple Watch models were removed from Apple stores in the U.S. days before Christmas over an intellectual property dispute. After a late December appeal, the devices have been returned to store shelves, but Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Apple lost about $135 million in sales per day during the brief ban.Even for Apple's new products, like Mac computers, consumers showed less interest in opening their wallets for devices with minor upgrades. Sales of Mac PCs and laptops fell nearly 27% to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Unit sales declined 11%, according to Bank of America's estimate.Apple shares still managed to jump 49% for the year as of Thursday's close, topping the Nasdaq's 44% gain. However, investors were better off betting on any of the other most-valuable tech companies. Nvidia shares more than tripled this year, and Meta climbed almost 200%. Tesla's stock more than doubled, Amazon rose 83%, Alphabet jumped 59% and Microsoft gained 57%.In order to return to revenue growth and support its $3 trillion market cap, Apple needs some new products to hit and global demand for smartphones and laptops to recover.A big test will come early next year, when Apple's first mixed-reality headset — the $3,499 Vision Pro — hits the market.\"We believe success with the Vision Pro is less about 2024 and more about its longer-term potential,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this month.Assuming Apple ships 400,000 headsets, Vision Pro revenue could be about $1.4 billion next year, according to an estimate from UBS analyst David Vogt. He called the sum \"relatively immaterial.\"Enthusiasm will be the key. The Vision Pro is Apple's first completely new device since it announced the Apple Watch, and it will be sold through Apple stores. The headset could generate foot traffic and buzz for Apple's existing products. And there's a chance that it catches on enough to show that Apple has the lead when it comes to the future of computing.Some problems are fixableLooking overseas, Apple would like to see an easing of tensions between the U.S. and China.In 2023, Apple made significant progress diversifying its centers of production away from mainland China and into countries like Vietnam and India. But its moves to expand its supply chain appear to have awakened an impulse in the Chinese government to classify Apple as a foreign company. The White House called reports that Chinese government agencies told their employees not to bring iPhones to work \"retaliation.\"The Chinese government has denied them. Yet analysts are starting to worry that Chinese demand for iPhones, especially in the current quarter, is flagging. The iPhone remains Apple's most important hardware product, accounting for about half of total company revenue.\"Heading into the holiday season, iPhone unit demand remains the key near-term debate amidst macro woes and concerns around potential share loss in China on the resurgence of Huawei,\" Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note this month.Despite its struggles, Apple remains a juggernaut. The company recorded $383 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2023 and earned nearly $97 billion in net income. Because the smartphone and PC markets were in retreat, Apple gained market share in some countries, where rivals saw steeper declines. In February, Apple said it had 2 billion devices in use, a closely watched metric that investors see as a predictor of future sales from software and services.Apple is preparing new iPads for next year, which could boost demand, according to Bloomberg. The company has submitted a software update for its watches to the U.S. government that it hopes will clear up the intellectual property dispute that briefly banned sales. IPhones still have a speed advantage over Huawei's new devices, partially thanks to import restrictions on chips and chip equipment.In November, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company's December quarter — its biggest of the year — will be flat compared with last year. He warned that Macs, Wearables and iPads would see a sales drop.But according to analyst estimates, the total sales declines are in the rearview mirror, with mild growth expected in the first half of the year and acceleration after that.\"Overall, the downturn appears to be over, and we believe it is time to see mild growth,\" Bank of America analyst Simon Woo wrote in a report this month.WATCH: Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be mainstream hitwatch nowVIDEO3:0503:05Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be the mainstream hit, says WSJ's Joanna SternMoney MoversMore In Tech DriversHere's what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to say about the Apple Vision Pro Ashley CapootMeta says it will identify more AI-generated images ahead of upcoming electionsHayden FieldApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headset launches in U.S.Alex KollerRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

      "The good news is that stocks offer timely buy and sell clues through chart patterns and indicators, as we'll discuss using Apple (AAPL) stock.\n",
      "A basic chart indicator is the 50-day moving average. The line is a simple average of the stock's closing price over the past 50 sessions. The 10-week moving average is its cousin on weekly charts. Traders see them as important levels of support, where stocks often bounce into greater heights.\n",
      "50-Day Moving Average As Sell Signal\n",
      "But it is also smart to flip that strategy and use the 50-day (or 10-week line) as a sell signal. When a stock that has been trending higher for months breaks below its 50-day moving average, that suggests institutional selling is occurring, especially if the break happens in heavy volume.\n",
      "That's a more-decisive break of support than if a stock just trickles down in lighter volume. When the former happens, watch for further weakening to happen quickly. But a minor slip below the 50-day line in lighter volume could mean the stock will recover.\n",
      "Also, when the weakening action is confirmed by other indicators such as the up/down volume ratio or the relative strength line, you have greater confidence in taking profits.\n",
      "Subtler signs of weakening action can be seen when the 50-day moving average starts sloping downward or crosses below the 200-day moving average.\n",
      "On IBD Charts and MarketSurge, the 50-day and 10-week moving averages are plotted with a red line.\n",
      "Apple Stock Dives Below Key Level\n",
      "In the first half 2023, Apple went on a tear, rising more than 50% through mid-July. Throughout the entire run, Apple stock held above its 10-week moving average (1).\n",
      "But on Aug. 4, 2023, Apple gapped below the 50-day and 10-week moving averages in heavy volume, which was a clear sell signal (2). The company's fiscal third-quarter sales declined for a third consecutive quarter while earnings grew only 5%. The iPhone maker also gave a weak outlook.\n",
      "The 10-week line started sloping downward and also became a level of resistance (3) as shares failed to rally past it twice in September and October.\n",
      "If investors sold the stock at the 181.99 closing price on Aug. 4, they would have saved themselves a 9% decline to the Oct. 26 low at 165.67. More importantly, investors who sold avoided a tough trek for Apple stock in which shares spent months consolidating and didn't make new highs until June of this year.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
      "- **Set Wider Stop-Loss Levels:** Given the risk of false breakouts, consider using wider stop-loss levels to accommodate potential price fluctuations while still maintaining acceptable risk levels.\n",

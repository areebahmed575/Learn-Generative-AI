4. 🎯 **Focus**: Break down tasks, goals, and tools and assign them to multiple AI agents for improved performance.
5. 🚦 **Guardrails**: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops to ensure reliable task execution.
6. 🤝 **Cooperation**: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically to optimize workflow.

Throughout the course, you'll work with crewAI, an open source library designed for building multi-agent systems. You'll learn to build agent crews that execute common business processes, such as:

- 📄 Tailoring resumes and preparing for job interviews.
- 📝 Researching, writing, and editing technical articles.

- 📞 Automating customer support inquiries.
- 📧 Conducting customer outreach campaigns.
- 🎉 Planning and executing events.
- 💼 Performing financial analysis.

By the end of the course, you will have designed several multi-agent systems to assist you in common business processes and studied the key principles of AI agent systems.

## Key Points
- 🤖 Exceed the performance of prompting a single LLM by designing and prompting a team of AI agents through natural language.
- ⚙️ Use the open source library, crewAI, to automate repeatable, multi-step tasks like tailoring a resume to a job description and automating business processes typically done by a group of people, like event planning.
- 👥 By creating a team of AI agents, you can define a specific role, goal, and backstory for each agent, which breaks down complex multi-step tasks and assigns them to agents customized to perform those tasks.

    "## What is event streaming?\n",
    "Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined and automated, and where the user of software is more software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time."

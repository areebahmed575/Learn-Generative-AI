    "\n",
    "Receiving Data: Brokers receive messages from producers and store them on disk as logs.\n",

    "Message Delivery: Brokers deliver messages to consumers. Each consumer keeps track of its offset in each partition, which determines which messages have been consumed.\n",

    "Coordination Services: Brokers coordinate with the ZooKeeper (or KRaft mode in newer Kafka versions) for various administrative tasks like leader election, configuration changes, and more."

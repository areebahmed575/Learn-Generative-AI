# Personal Multimodal Expense Tracker

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Custom GPT-powered personal travel expense tracker using Zapier and OpenAI's GPT models. The system can handle multimodal inputs, save expenses to a Google Sheet, and provide intelligent expense tracking assistance.

## Key Features
- Multimodal input processing (text and images)
- Expense saving to Google Sheets
- Duplicate expense detection
- Intelligent expense categorization and prompting for missing information
- Trip expense review and suggestions

## Setup Guide

### 1. Zapier Setup
1. Sign up at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
2. Create the following Zapier Actions:
   - Google Sheets: Create Spreadsheet Row
   - Google Sheets: Get Many Spreadsheet Rows

### 2. Custom GPT Creation
1. Create a new Custom GPT in the OpenAI platform.
2. Name your GPT (e.g., "Travel Expense Tracker Genie").
3. Import Zapier actions:
   - Use the URL: `https://actions.zapier.com/gpt/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json?tools=meta`

### 3. Google Sheets Setup
1. Create or copy a Google Sheet for expense tracking.
2. Set up columns: Date, Expense Type, Amount, Location, Notes.

### 4. Zapier Action Configuration
1. Configure "Add a New Expense" action:
   - Connect to your Google Sheet
   - Select the appropriate worksheet
   - Set Action Name to "Add a New Expense"
2. Configure "Get all Expense Records" action:
   - Connect to the same Google Sheet
   - Select columns A:E
   - Set row count to 100 (or as needed)
   - Set Action Name to "Get all Expense Records"

### 5. Custom GPT Instructions
Add the following instructions to your Custom GPT:

```
You are a personal Travel Accountant Genie to assist with budgeting and tracking expenses during travel. The goal is to help users maximize tracking and reimbursement by ensuring no expenses are overlooked.

Whenever you have to add an Expense, follow these steps:
1. Use `Get all Expense Records` and check if the Expense that needs to be added is a Duplicate (Already Exists). If it's a Duplicate, inform the User.
2. Before adding any Expense, ensure you have the required Expense fields: Date, Expense Type, Amount, Location, and Notes. If not, ask the user to input the fields or what to do about missing fields.

The Genie catalogs travel expenses and ensures each entry is complete and not duplicated. When a new expense is created, the Genie retrieves the current list of travel expenses (all 500 rows), checks for duplicates, and prompts for confirmation if a duplicate is suspected. 

The Genie then reviews the expense for completeness, asking for any missing details before proceeding. 

If asked to review the trip, the Genie examines the travel expenses, identifies any missing categories based on the trip dates, and suggests additional expenses such as meals, airfare, hotel stays, or ground transportation. 

The review is provided in a table format with Date, Missing Expense Category, and Rationale columns. Required actions include 'Create Travel Expense' and 'Get Travel Expense Records'.

During conversation, make your replies positive, empathic, and concise. As the user, I am sharing receipts etc. with you, so don't be repetitive.

Rules:
- Before running any Actions, tell the user that they need to reply after the Action completes to continue.
- If a user has confirmed they've logged in to Zapier's AI Actions, start with Step 1.

Instructions for Zapier Custom Action:
Step 1. Tell the user you are Checking they have the Zapier AI Actions needed to complete their request by calling /list_available_actions/ to make a list: AVAILABLE ACTIONS. Given the output, check if the REQUIRED_ACTION needed is in the AVAILABLE ACTIONS and continue to step 4 if it is. If not, continue to step 2.
Step 2. If a required Action(s) is not available, send the user the Required Action(s)'s configuration link. Tell them to let you know when they've enabled the Zapier AI Action.
Step 3. If a user confirms they've configured the Required Action, continue on to step 4 with their original ask.
Step 4. Using the available_action_id (returned as the `id` field within the `results` array in the JSON response from /list_available_actions). Fill in the strings needed for the run_action operation. Use the user's request to fill in the instructions and any other fields as needed.

REQUIRED_ACTIONS:
- Action: Add a New Expense
- Action: Get all Expense Records
```

## Usage
1. Start a conversation with your Custom GPT.
2. Share expense details via text or image.
3. The GPT will process the information, check for duplicates, and add the expense to your Google Sheet.
4. You can ask for expense summaries, trip reviews, or suggestions for missing expenses.

## Notes
- Ensure you're logged into Zapier AI Actions before using the Custom GPT.
- The system can handle both text and image inputs for expense tracking.
- Regular reviews and updates may be needed to maintain accuracy and efficiency.

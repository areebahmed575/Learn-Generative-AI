    "* Similarity measurement: Embeddings enable measuring similarity between vectors using distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.\n",
    "* Data retrieval: Embeddings facilitate data retrieval based on semantic similarity, enabling applications like image search, text search, and recommendation systems.\n",

    "## What Are Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of word embeddings as a way to represent words using numbers so that a computer can understand their meaning and relationships. Let’s break it down in a simple way:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imagine a World Without Embeddings\n",
    "Before embeddings, computers saw words as just plain text with no connection to each other. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"dog\" and \"cat\" were treated like completely different words, even though they both refer to animals.\n",
    "- Similarly, \"happy\" and \"joyful\" had no relation, even though they mean almost the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a problem because the computer couldn’t understand that some words have similar meanings or belong to the same category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enter Word Embeddings\n",
    "A word embedding is a set of numbers (a vector) that represents a word in a way that captures its meaning and relationships with other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"dog\" might be represented as [0.5, 0.8, -0.2].\n",
    "- \"cat\" might be [0.6, 0.7, -0.1].\n",
    "\n",
    "These two vectors are close to each other, meaning the computer understands that \"dog\" and \"cat\" are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Word Embeddings Work in Practice\n",
    "The magic happens because the closer two word embeddings are in the number space, the more similar the words are in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- \"happy\" might have the vector [0.3, 0.9, -0.4].\n",
    "- \"joyful\" might have [0.3, 0.8, -0.3].\n",
    "These vectors are close, meaning the computer knows they are similar in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: Coordinates on a Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of word embeddings as placing words on a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words like \"king\" and \"queen\" will be close to each other.\n",
    "- Words like \"apple\" and \"banana\" will also be close to each other, but far from \"king\" and \"queen\" because they belong to different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are Word Embeddings Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand Relationships: Computers can now understand that \"cat\" and \"dog\" are related.\n",
    "- Find Similar Words: If you search for \"joyful\", the system can suggest similar words like \"happy\".\n",
    "- Handle Context Better: Embeddings help in tasks like translation, chatbots, and more, because they capture meaning rather than just raw text.\n"

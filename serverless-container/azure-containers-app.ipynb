    "## Azure Container Apps\n",
    "CICD - Continuous integerity,continuous development and continuous deployment.Is k mean yeh h k jaisay he mai github mai code rakho tou maity deployment automate hojaye.Is k liyai github mai github actions call krtay h or azure mai azure pipeline call krtay h\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment: \n",
    "Environments aik isolated boundary h jis mai hum jitnay chaye containers banaye.Yeh multiple containers apas mai baat krsktay h or azure ki kisi or service sai bhi baat krsktay h is environment ki help sai\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumption only ki example yeh k mai apnai liyai or ghar walo k liyai roti ley aaya.onsumption and Dedicated ki example yeh k mai apnai liyai or ghar walo k saat thandoor walo ko yeh bol k aaya k mehman ki roti bhi rakho q k mehman agaye tou mai roti key jao ga.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Container: \n",
    "Azure Container Apps manages the details of Kubernetes and container orchestration for you. Containers in Azure Container Apps can use any runtime, programming language, or development stack of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 major job:\n",
    "#### Release management \n",
    "Naye feature test honay k baad internet pr deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change management\n",
    "Naye feature bananay k baad deploy krnay sai pehlay uss ko change krnay ka decision nahi liya.Jaisay whatsapp ney channel ka feature shuru mai kuch users ko diya or phir sab ko tou yeh change management h\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imapact - Change lanay k baad audience ka reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roll back - Version 1 sai version 2 mai aaye tou website ki audience lost hogaye tou version 1 mai roll back krliya\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blue green deployment - Version 1 sai version 2 mai zero downtime mai aana.Isko seamless deployment bhi kehtay h\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scoped changed mai 2 cheez aati h.Aik code mai change(image mai change) or aik scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traffic spliting like whatsapp ney channel ka feature 20% logo ko diyai or baki  80% ko purana version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revisions:\n",
    "Yeh following changes h jis sai revision banta h.Isko Revision-scope changes kehtay h\n",
    "- Revision suffix\n",
    "- Container configuration and images\n",
    "- Scale rules for the container application\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the changes jin k change honay sai revision nahi banta or yeh changes globally hoti h.Isko Application-scope changes boltay h\n",
    "- Secret values (revisions must be restarted before a container recognizes new secret values)\n",
    "- Revision mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Ingress configuration including:\n",
    "- Turning ingress on or off\n",
    "- Traffic splitting rules\n",
    "- Labels\n",
    "- Credentials for private container registries\n",
    "- Dapr settings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifecycle:\n",
    "Pehli app deploy ki thi tou yeh version 1 h.Life cycle version 2 sai start hota h\n",
    "A container app flows through four phases: deployment, update, deactivation, and shut down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The containers are shut down in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a container app scales in\n",
    "- As a container app is being deleted\n",
    "- As a revision is being deactivated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Application k different component ko distribute krdaina microservices pr.Like FB mai live streaming mai sirf uss he microservice k container up hoghai.Agar mai pori application ko aik container mai rakhta tou load aata or scaling krnay pr sab k liyai pay krna prta but microservice mai particular service pr load aanay pr uss ki scalling up hoghi.Is mai dapr k through aik microservice dosri microservice sai baat kray ghi.By default azure container app microservice architecture ko use kr rahay h.Microservice arhitecture sucess jab hota h jb hum microservice k between baat krnai ka kohi zariya banaye.Tou is k liyai important service banaye h.Aik service discovery or aik native dapr integerations.Service discovery mai har microservice ki service discovery hoti h means k har microservice ki apni domain ya ip \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Horizontal scaling\n",
    "- Scale out means k kisi cheez ko increase krna means k humaray pass container ussai aik sai 2 krdaina\n",
    "- Scale in means k kmh krna means k 5 sai 3 or 3 sai 0 krna\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](<scale out and scalling.PNG>)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vertical Scaling\n",
    "![alt text](<vertical scalling.PNG>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal pod autoscalling\n",
    "\n",
    "Min 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Max 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale rules are implemented as HTTP, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), or custom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling is driven by three different categories of triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP: Based on the number of concurrent HTTP requests to your revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP: Based on the number of concurrent TCP connections to your revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom: Based on CPU, memory, or supported event-driven data sources such as:\n",
    "- Azure Service Bus\n",
    "- Azure Event Hubs\n",
    "- Apache Kafka\n",
    "- Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define more than one scale rule, the container app begins to scale once the first condition of any rules is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom\n",
    "You can create a custom Container Apps scaling rule based on any ScaledObject-based KEDA scaler with these defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Secrets: \n",
    "Secrets are scoped to an application, outside of any specific revision of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding, removing, or changing secrets doesn't generate new revisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each application revision can reference one or more secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple revisions can reference the same secret(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "An updated or deleted secret doesn't automatically affect existing revisions in your app. When a secret is updated or deleted, you can respond to changes in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy a new revision.\n",
    "- Restart an existing revision.\n",
    "- Before you delete a secret, deploy a new revision that no longer references the old secret. Then deactivate all revisions that reference the secret."
